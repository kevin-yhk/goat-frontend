# goat-frontend
This is the front end repo for the goat web app. The back-end can be found on https://github.com/kevin-yhk/goat. Fork and clone the back-end repo and run rails db:migrate. Once your migrations have been set up, run rails s to run the server. Then in the front end you can open up the index.html in your preferred browser and will be able to interact with the web app.
